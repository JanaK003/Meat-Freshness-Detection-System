Tagline
Detecting the freshness of meat using an Arduino board, TCS34725 color sensor, and LCD display

Introduction Section
What is this project?
This project uses an Arduino board, a TCS34725 color sensor, and an LCD display to detect the freshness of meat. The color sensor measures the RGB values of the meat, and the Arduino board processes these values to determine if the meat is fresh or not. The result is displayed on the LCD display.

Why was this project created?
This project was created to provide a simple and cost-effective way to detect the freshness of meat. It can be used in various applications such as food quality control, meat processing, and food safety.

Getting Started Section
Prerequisites
Arduino Board
TCS34725 Color Sensor
LCD Display
Air Quality Sensor
Breadboard and jumper wires for connections
Installation
Connect the TCS34725 color sensor to the Arduino board as shown in the circuit diagram.
Connect the LCD display to the Arduino board as shown in the circuit diagram.
Connect the air quality sensor to the Arduino board as shown in the circuit diagram.
Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
Usage
Place the meat sample in front of the color sensor.
The Arduino board will measure the RGB values of the meat and determine if it is fresh or not.
The result will be displayed on the LCD display.
The air quality sensor will also measure the air quality and display the value on the serial monitor.
